Today I focused primarly on the database structure and how I will build the game rooms on firebase Firestore. As of right now I can create a private room in the game which a second player with a different account can join by over a special ID/code that is saves in firestore. Next I want to focus on the actual game

### 05.09.2025
- [ ] I want to update the design of the WPF application. better colors etc.
- [ ] I want to make it so that when the LLM is generating I should see it generating on the App real time rather than later.
- [ ] In the holidays I created many websites, such as a portfolio, a quiz generator, a toke taking app with AI capabilities aswell as a graph generator. I want to find a commen theme and color pallete that looks proffesional for advertisment for future internships.

Today I focused on improving my WPF application by planning to update its design with better colors and a more professional look. I also want to enhance the user experience by making the LLM’s responses appear in real time instead of all at once. Reflecting on the holidays, I realized I created several websites, including a portfolio, a quiz generator, a note-taking app with AI features, and a graph generator. I found a common theme and color palette to unify these projects, making them look polished and suitable for showcasing in future internship applications.


### 29.08.2025
- [ ] I want to create a feature that takes a screenshot of the whole screen without the AI assistant App being in it.
- [ ] I want to meke it similar to the live screenshare feature that gemini offres.
- [ ] I want to test other models

Today, I worked on enhancing my AI assistant application. I focused on developing a feature to capture full-screen screenshots while ensuring the app window is excluded, inspired by Gemini's live screenshare functionality. I also explored integrating and testing other AI models to expand the app's capabilities.


### 22.08.2025
- [ ] I want to add a screenshot feature that works similar to the circle to search feature on android devices
- [ ] As of right now the code calls the LLM when I send my prompt and it runs ollama and generates a response and then closes. I want to add a feature that allows gemma to understand context.
- [ ] I want to test my app and see how much it can do with analysising text and solving math equations using the screenshot feature.

Today, I enhanced my AI assistant WPF application by implementing a screenshot feature inspired by Android’s Circle to Search. This allows users to select a screen region for image analysis by the Gemma3:4b LLM, integrated via the Ollama API. The feature captures the selected area, saves it as a PNG, and sends it to the AI for processing, displaying results in a streaming chat bubble. I tested the functionality with basic image analysis queries to ensure accuracy.



### 15.08.2025
- [ ] I want to find an LLM, which can input Text and images and give out good responses
- [ ] I want to create a GUI in either pygame or WPF application
- [ ] I want to integrate the LLM into that app

The goal is to develop an AI assistant app that operates seamlessly offline, capable of analyzing screenshots, images, and text. I downloaded the Gemma3:4b LLM from Ollama and tested it in a command prompt with basic image analysis queries to ensure accuracy. Satisfied with the results, I built a WPF application with a user-friendly GUI to eliminate the need for memorizing specific commands or extra steps to run the model. The app can be launched directly from the Taskbar for quick question-asking. Next, I plan to add a screenshot feature, allowing users to select a portion of the screen, similar to Android’s Circle to Search functionality.

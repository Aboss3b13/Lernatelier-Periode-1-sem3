- [ ] I want to find an LLM, which can input Text and images and give out good responses
- [ ] I want to create a GUI in either pygame or WPF application
- [ ] I want to integrate the LLM into that app

The goal is to develop an AI assistant app that operates seamlessly offline, capable of analyzing screenshots, images, and text. I downloaded the Gemma3:4b LLM from Ollama and tested it in a command prompt with basic image analysis queries to ensure accuracy. Satisfied with the results, I built a WPF application with a user-friendly GUI to eliminate the need for memorizing specific commands or extra steps to run the model. The app can be launched directly from the Taskbar for quick question-asking. Next, I plan to add a screenshot feature, allowing users to select a portion of the screen, similar to Androidâ€™s Circle to Search functionality.

- [ ] I want to add a screenshot feature that works similar to the circle to search feature on android devices
- [ ] As of right now the code calls the LLM when I send my prompt and it runs ollama and generates a response and then closes. I want to add a feature that allows the bot to understand context.
- [ ] I want to create an AI music generator which which generates MIDI that gets played back with a soundfont.

### 21.11.2025

- [ ] Gemini 3.0 finally released. I want to test it.
- [ ] Download and learn how to use antigravity.
- [ ] Use antigravity to work on my music generator
- [ ] Work on the design and animations for my rubik's cube simulator

Today I tested out google's latest language model gemini 3.0. They also released an IDE antigravity that is very AI centric. So I learned how to use it and tested it out. After that I worked on my Rubik's Cube simulator. I added animations and updated the design of the cube

### 14.11.2025
- [ ] I want to create an app that simulates a rubik's cube
- [ ] Find a platworm that can render 3d which is easy to use and program with. I am thinking about using a wpf application.
- [ ] Come up with logic that simulates a rubik's Cube

I worked on my  project which I started working on in april. A 3d rubiks cube simulator. I had an algorith which would work in 2d. So today I used the same algorithm to render it in 3d using a wpf application. Next I want to work on an algorithm to solve the cube

### 07.11.2025
- [ ] I want to continue working on my music generator
- [ ] find a consistant good algorithm that generates decent random music
- [ ] implement it

I came up with an algorithm that makes good sounding music per default. The AI that generates the music still won't produce good sounding music though. Although this is probably because of the current AI model cannot comprehend what good music is supposed to sound like.

### 31.10.2025
- [ ] I want to work on my Video/Presentation generator.
- [ ] My credits with google cloud ran out so I dont have accses to their voice anymore. I want to find a new voice.
- [ ] Fix some formatting, add animations etc.

I worked on my presentation generator. I used Microsofts free voices that do not require an API key instead of using google's. I fixed some formatting issues.

      

### 24.10.2025
- [ ] I want to continue working on my music generator
- [ ] I want to come up with an algorithm that creates good sounding music
- [ ] Implement that algorithm

Today I tried to find an algorithm that generates good soundig music. I tried using AI to create the algorithm, but I didnt get any succsesful results.


### 17.10.2025
- [ ] I want to work on the OBA for M320
- [ ] In the summer holidays I made a music generator. I want to perfect it. I want to experiment with AI and see what it can come up with.
- [ ] compare multipul versions with oneanother

Today I worked on the OBA for M320. Then I started working on a music generator with an algorithm that is better than the one that I used before. I will be working on that next time along with my Portfolio Website.




### 19.09.2025
- [ ] I want to continue on the said game. I will start by looking at what I have scomplished so far
- [ ] I want to create the database structure on how all the datas will be saved on firebase.
- [ ] Update the firestore rules that allow me to perform HTTP requests.
- [ ] Start thinking about the game logic

Today I focused primarly on the database structure and how I will build the game rooms on firebase Firestore. As of right now I can create a private room in the game which a second player with a different account can join by over a special ID/code that is saves in firestore. Next I want to focus on the actual game


### 12.09.2025
- [ ] I want to create a web game that simulates online pokemon battles
- [ ] I will start with the basic design
- [ ] implement basic authentication

Today I started a new project. I strarted to create a pokemon web app game. I want it to be a multiplayer pokemon battle game where you can log in and then create a battle room which your oppenment can join in the lobby. As of right now I can register/login and I created a basic design. I started to program the game logic.


### 05.09.2025
- [ ] I want to update the design of the WPF application. better colors etc.
- [ ] I want to make it so that when the LLM is generating I should see it generating on the App real time rather than later.
- [ ] In the holidays I created many websites, such as a portfolio, a quiz generator, a toke taking app with AI capabilities aswell as a graph generator. I want to find a commen theme and color pallete that looks proffesional for advertisment for future internships.

Today I focused on improving my WPF application by planning to update its design with better colors and a more professional look. I also want to enhance the user experience by making the LLM’s responses appear in real time instead of all at once. Reflecting on the holidays, I realized I created several websites, including a portfolio, a quiz generator, a note-taking app with AI features, and a graph generator. I found a common theme and color palette to unify these projects, making them look polished and suitable for showcasing in future internship applications.


### 29.08.2025
- [ ] I want to create a feature that takes a screenshot of the whole screen without the AI assistant App being in it.
- [ ] I want to meke it similar to the live screenshare feature that gemini offres.
- [ ] I want to test other models

Today, I worked on enhancing my AI assistant application. I focused on developing a feature to capture full-screen screenshots while ensuring the app window is excluded, inspired by Gemini's live screenshare functionality. I also explored integrating and testing other AI models to expand the app's capabilities.


### 22.08.2025
- [ ] I want to add a screenshot feature that works similar to the circle to search feature on android devices
- [ ] As of right now the code calls the LLM when I send my prompt and it runs ollama and generates a response and then closes. I want to add a feature that allows gemma to understand context.
- [ ] I want to test my app and see how much it can do with analysising text and solving math equations using the screenshot feature.

Today, I enhanced my AI assistant WPF application by implementing a screenshot feature inspired by Android’s Circle to Search. This allows users to select a screen region for image analysis by the Gemma3:4b LLM, integrated via the Ollama API. The feature captures the selected area, saves it as a PNG, and sends it to the AI for processing, displaying results in a streaming chat bubble. I tested the functionality with basic image analysis queries to ensure accuracy.



### 15.08.2025
- [ ] I want to find an LLM, which can input Text and images and give out good responses
- [ ] I want to create a GUI in either pygame or WPF application
- [ ] I want to integrate the LLM into that app

The goal is to develop an AI assistant app that operates seamlessly offline, capable of analyzing screenshots, images, and text. I downloaded the Gemma3:4b LLM from Ollama and tested it in a command prompt with basic image analysis queries to ensure accuracy. Satisfied with the results, I built a WPF application with a user-friendly GUI to eliminate the need for memorizing specific commands or extra steps to run the model. The app can be launched directly from the Taskbar for quick question-asking. Next, I plan to add a screenshot feature, allowing users to select a portion of the screen, similar to Android’s Circle to Search functionality.
